## Project Description: 

The purpose of the project is to develop an analysis for interpreting data from yellow taxis and uber rides from January 2009 and June 2015. The motivation for this project
arises from Uber's announcement (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/business/uber-new-york-taxis.html) to enable users to book yellow taxis from the Uber app.
The team aimed to get insights and observe trends based on each trip's recorded data.
